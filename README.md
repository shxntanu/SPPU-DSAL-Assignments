# SPPU DSAL Assignments

Programming Assignments of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Second Year (SE) Computer Engineering (CE), Data Structures and Algorithms Lab (DSAL) 2022-23.

## Question 1

Beginning with an empty binary search tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree -
- Insert new node, 
- Find number of nodes in longest path from root, 
- Minimum data value found in the tree, 
- Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node, 
- Search a value.

## Question 2

Beginning with an empty binary tree, Construct binary search tree by inserting
the values in the order given. After constructing a binary tree, perform the
following operations on it -
1. Perform inorder, preorder and postorder traversal
2. Change a tree so that the roles of the left and right pointers are swapped at every node
3. Find the height of the tree
4. Copy this tree to another tree (operator =)
5. Count number of leaves, number of internal nodes
6. Erase all nodes in a binary tree

(implement both recursive and iterative methods)
